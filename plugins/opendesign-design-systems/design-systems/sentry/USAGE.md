# Sentry Usage

Design System 2.0 package guide for FreeCode agents and reviewers.

## Read Order

1. Read this file first to understand the package contract.
2. Read `DESIGN.md` for visual intent, constraints, and anti-patterns.
3. Paste `tokens.css` into the first artifact `<style>` block before writing component CSS.
4. Use `components.manifest.json` for the compact component inventory; open `components.html` when exact selectors or states matter.
5. Inspect `preview/` pages when a visual sanity check is useful.

## Design Highlights

- Dark purple-black backgrounds (`#1f1633`, `#150f23`) — never pure black
- Warm purple accent spectrum: from deep (`#362d59`) through mid (`#79628c`, `#6a5fc1`) to vibrant (`#422082`)
- Lime-green accent (`#c2ef4e`) for high-visibility CTAs and highlights
- Pink/coral accents (`#ffb287`, `#fa7faa`) for focus states and secondary highlights

## Do

- Preserve the schema token names exactly so cross-brand switching stays reliable.
- Use `--accent` for primary actions, links, focus states, and one clear focal element.
- Reuse component groups from `components.manifest.json` before inventing new controls.
- Treat `source/` files as audit evidence for the bundled fixture backfill.

## Avoid

- Avoid raw hex values outside the copied `:root` token block.
- Avoid redefining Tailwind or design-token values independently of `tokens.css`.
- Avoid claiming original upstream source evidence; this package is based on the curated bundled fixture.
- Avoid adding new component recipes that are not represented in `components.html` or `DESIGN.md`.
