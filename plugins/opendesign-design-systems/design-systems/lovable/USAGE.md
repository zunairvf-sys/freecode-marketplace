# Lovable Usage

Design System 2.0 package guide for FreeCode agents and reviewers.

## Read Order

1. Read this file first to understand the package contract.
2. Read `DESIGN.md` for visual intent, constraints, and anti-patterns.
3. Paste `tokens.css` into the first artifact `<style>` block before writing component CSS.
4. Use `components.manifest.json` for the compact component inventory; open `components.html` when exact selectors or states matter.
5. Inspect `preview/` pages when a visual sanity check is useful.

## Design Highlights

- Warm parchment background (`#f7f4ed`) — not white, not beige, a deliberate cream that feels hand-selected
- Camera Plain Variable typeface with humanist warmth and editorial letter-spacing at display sizes
- Opacity-driven color system: all grays derived from `#1c1c1c` at varying transparency levels
- Inset shadow technique on buttons: `rgba(255,255,255,0.2) 0px 0.5px 0px 0px inset, rgba(0,0,0,0.2) 0px 0px 0px 0.5px inset`

## Do

- Preserve the schema token names exactly so cross-brand switching stays reliable.
- Use `--accent` for primary actions, links, focus states, and one clear focal element.
- Reuse component groups from `components.manifest.json` before inventing new controls.
- Treat `source/` files as audit evidence for the bundled fixture backfill.

## Avoid

- Avoid raw hex values outside the copied `:root` token block.
- Avoid redefining Tailwind or design-token values independently of `tokens.css`.
- Avoid claiming original upstream source evidence; this package is based on the curated bundled fixture.
- Avoid adding new component recipes that are not represented in `components.html` or `DESIGN.md`.
