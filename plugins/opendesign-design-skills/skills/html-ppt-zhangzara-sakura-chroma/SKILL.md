# Sakura Chroma

> Vintage Japanese cassette-package aesthetic: cream paper, diagonal rainbow ribbons, condensed bold type, JIS-style spec checkboxes.

A single self-contained HTML deck — typography, palette, decorative system,
and slide vocabulary are all tuned together. Mixing layouts across templates
breaks the system; stay inside this one.

## At a glance

- **Scheme:** light
- **Formality:** low
- **Density:** medium
- **Slides in demo:** 8

## Best for

Anything that should feel like a vintage Japanese cassette package or a TDK / Sony / Sakura Color product catalogue: indie hardware brand decks, music-label release schedules, analog studio retrospectives, zine and magazine pitches, kawaii-tech product launches, creative-studio annual reports. Equally good for any deck wanting bold colour, condensed display type, and a tactile printed-product personality.

## Avoid for

Decks that need restrained, corporate, or quiet typography — the bold condensed lockups, ribbon stripes, and primary-colour palette are intentionally loud and product-page-y.

## Workflow

1. **Clone `example.html`** into the user's workspace as the working file.
2. **Replace placeholder content** with the user's real headlines, body copy,
   numbers, names, dates, and section labels. Match existing dimensions when
   swapping image placeholders.
3. **Preserve the design system.** Never substitute fonts, recolor the palette,
   restructure the layout grid, or strip decorative elements (corner brackets,
   paper grain, geometric shapes, illustrated SVGs). They are part of the
   identity.
4. **Adjust deck length by duplicating layouts.** If the user has more content
   than the demo holds, duplicate an existing slide of the most appropriate
   layout. If less, drop slides from the bottom. Update page-number labels.
5. **Designing missing layouts:** if a slide needs a layout the template
   doesn't have, design it from scratch using the same fonts, palette,
   decorative vocabulary, spacing rhythm, and component grammar — never bail
   to a different template.
6. **Keep the navigation runtime as shipped.** If the deck ships an
   `assets/deck-stage.js` or inline keyboard handler, leave it intact.
