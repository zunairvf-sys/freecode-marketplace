# Codex Interactive Capability Map

Transform a long article, social thread, memo, product essay, or launch narrative into a visual explainer that people can scan and click through.

## Use When

- The input is mostly text and the user wants a clearer mental model.
- The content contains repeated concepts, a process, a framework, capabilities, or operating principles.
- The desired output is a polished web artifact, not a static summary.

## Workflow

1. Read the source material and extract 6-10 core concepts.
2. Name the overall model in plain language. Prefer a short noun phrase such as "Operating Model", "Capability Map", or "Workflow Loop".
3. Build three linked views:
   - A hero that frames the source and the promise.
   - A workflow loop that shows the main sequence or system.
   - A use-case matrix that combines concepts into practical scenarios.
4. Add a right-side detail panel. Clicking any nav item, loop node, matrix card, or maturity level must update the panel.
5. Make the clicked element and the detail panel visibly correspond through shared color, motion, icon/mark shape, or gradient.
6. Keep copy short. The artifact should reduce reading effort, not recreate the article.

## Visual Direction

- Use a Codex-inspired refined product style with soft liquid motion, glassy surfaces, and crisp functional controls.
- Make the first viewport feel like a finished product surface, not a wireframe.
- Favor diagrams, loops, matrices, rails, cards, and progressive disclosure over paragraphs.
- Use meaningful hover and active states. A click should feel consequential.
- Avoid external image dependencies unless the user explicitly provides assets.

## Interaction Requirements

- All clickable elements must update content or scroll to a meaningful section.
- The active state must be visually obvious.
- The detail panel should animate on each change.
- Long labels must wrap cleanly and never be clipped.
- The layout must work at 1280px wide and collapse cleanly below 900px.

## Output Contract

Emit one single-file HTML artifact:

```html
<artifact identifier="codex-interactive-capability-map" type="text/html" title="Codex Interactive Capability Map">
<!doctype html>
<html>...</html>
</artifact>
```

Include all CSS and JavaScript inline. Do not use lorem ipsum. Do not leave placeholder cards. If the source does not include enough concrete details, infer a small, clearly labeled conceptual model from the source instead of inventing unrelated content.
