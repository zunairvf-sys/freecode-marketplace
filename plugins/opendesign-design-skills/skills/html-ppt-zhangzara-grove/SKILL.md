# Grove

> Forest-green canvas with cream type, classical Playfair serifs, and a single rust accent.

A single self-contained HTML deck — typography, palette, decorative system,
and slide vocabulary are all tuned together. Mixing layouts across templates
breaks the system; stay inside this one.

## At a glance

- **Scheme:** mixed
- **Formality:** medium-high
- **Density:** medium
- **Slides in demo:** 12

## Best for

Anything that should feel organic, considered, and grown-up: sustainability and wellness brands, outdoor / nature products, wineries and restaurants, literary or arts decks, advisory deliverables, bilingual EN/CN reports. Also a calm, distinctive choice for tech, research, or business decks that want patience over urgency.

## Avoid for

Decks that need neon energy or rapid-fire pop — the forest-green canvas and Playfair serif commit to a slow, classical voice.

## Workflow

1. **Clone `example.html`** into the user's workspace as the working file.
2. **Replace placeholder content** with the user's real headlines, body copy,
   numbers, names, dates, and section labels. Match existing dimensions when
   swapping image placeholders.
3. **Preserve the design system.** Never substitute fonts, recolor the palette,
   restructure the layout grid, or strip decorative elements (corner brackets,
   paper grain, geometric shapes, illustrated SVGs). They are part of the
   identity.
4. **Adjust deck length by duplicating layouts.** If the user has more content
   than the demo holds, duplicate an existing slide of the most appropriate
   layout. If less, drop slides from the bottom. Update page-number labels.
5. **Designing missing layouts:** if a slide needs a layout the template
   doesn't have, design it from scratch using the same fonts, palette,
   decorative vocabulary, spacing rhythm, and component grammar — never bail
   to a different template.
6. **Keep the navigation runtime as shipped.** If the deck ships an
   `assets/deck-stage.js` or inline keyboard handler, leave it intact.
