# Replit Deck Skill

Produce a single-file horizontal-swipe HTML deck in one of eight Replit-Slides themes. Every theme is a complete visual system — do not mix tokens across themes.

## Resource map

```
replit-deck/
├── SKILL.md                ← you're reading this
├── assets/
│   └── template.html       ← seed: 8 themes via [data-theme=*], proven iframe-nav script (READ FIRST)

└── examples/               ← four reference decks across the most contrasting themes
    ├── example-helix.html       (SaaS board update · light minimal)
    ├── example-holm.html        (legal fintech memo · cream editorial serif)
    ├── example-atlas.html       (quarterly history chapter · black + vermilion)
    └── example-bluehouse.html   (real estate ROI · navy + gradient cards)
```

## Workflow

### Step 0 — Pre-flight (mandatory reads)

1. Read `assets/template.html` end-to-end. The `[data-theme]` blocks carry the tokens; the `<script>` at the bottom solves five iframe nav bugs — **do not rewrite it**.
2. Read `references/themes.md` → pick **one** theme that matches the user's brief. If the user already picked a theme via `od.inputs.theme`, use that.
3. Read `references/layouts.md` → you'll copy `<section>` blocks from here.
4. Read `references/checklist.md` → P0 must pass before emit.

### Step 1 — Commit to one theme

Write out loud (in the TodoWrite or plan section) which theme and why. Once picked, **every slide uses that theme's tokens only**. No swapping mid-deck. The `<body data-theme="helix">` attribute is the single source of truth.

| Theme | Pick when |
|---|---|
| `helix` | SaaS board update, product metrics, neutral modern |
| `holm` | Legal memo, investor pre-read, serious / institutional |
| `vance` | Art portfolio, design catalog, photographer / sculptor |
| `bevel` | Fashion campaign, lookbook, Y2K / editorial attitude |
| `world-dark` | Policy report, finance analysis, premium dark |
| `world-mint` | Lighter companion of world-dark — ESG, wellness finance, sustainability |
| `atlas` | Long-form narrative, chapter deck, museum / archive aesthetic |
| `bluehouse` | Consumer product, real estate, lifestyle, colorful cards |

### Step 2 — Plan slide rhythm before writing HTML

Default 6 slides. Write the rhythm BEFORE any HTML, for example (helix, 6 slides):

```
01  cover           hero + title + subtitle
02  kpi-row-6       6 metrics with ▲/▼ deltas
03  split-insight   left stat + right paragraph
04  chapter-plate   section divider
05  three-up        three parallel columns
06  closing         one bold number or CTA
```

Show this to the user. Redirecting at this stage is cheap.

### Step 3 — Copy seed, bind theme

1. Copy `assets/template.html` to project root as `index.html`.
2. Set `<body data-theme="<chosen>">`.
3. Replace `<title>`.
4. Delete the placeholder slides in the body (the seed ships with 3 demo slides). Keep the chrome (counter / progress / hint).

### Step 4 — Paste layouts, fill real copy

For each planned slide, copy the matching `<section>` from `references/layouts.md`. Replace every `[REPLACE]` with specific copy — never leave placeholders, never use lorem. If a slide feels empty, pick a different layout.

Tag each slide with `data-screen-label="01 Cover"`, `"02 Metrics"`, etc., in presentation order.

### Step 5 — Self-check

Run `references/checklist.md` silently before emit: the **P0 theme-lock gate** plus the five-dimension 1–5 critique (Philosophy / Hierarchy / Execution / Specificity / Restraint). Any dimension ≤ 3 → re-do before emit.

The P0 theme-lock grep is non-negotiable:

```bash
grep -E 'data-theme|style="--' index.html | head
```

If any `style="--accent:..."` or theme override appears on individual slides, revert. One theme per deck.

### Step 6 — Emit artifact

```
<artifact identifier="deck-<slug>" type="text/html" title="<Deck title>">
<!doctype html>
<html>...</html>
</artifact>
```

One sentence before the artifact. Stop after `</artifact>`.

## Hard rules

- **One theme per deck.** `data-theme` set on `<body>` — never override per-slide.
- **Numbers are real or absent.** No invented metrics. Use `—` or a grey block as an honest placeholder.
- **Display face follows theme.** helix/world-dark/world-mint/bluehouse use the sans Display; holm/vance/atlas use the serif Display; bevel uses the Y2K display. Do not swap. (Authoritative source: the `--font-display` token of each theme in `assets/template.html` — if this list ever disagrees with the template, the template wins.)
- **Accent appears 1–2× per slide max.** Never a gradient-spam.
- **Never rewrite the nav script.** Five iframe bugs it solves are not obvious.
- **Keep it one HTML file.** Inline all CSS. No external fonts — the system stack in each theme is deliberate.
- **`data-screen-label` on every slide.**
- **No Replit logo / brand lockup.** These are template styles, not a Replit-brand deck.

## When to pick `replit-deck` vs. peer skills

| Skill | Pick when |
|---|---|
| `simple-deck` | Plain, single-theme deck bound to the project's `DESIGN.md` tokens. When the deck should *match* the host brand, not assert its own. (`designSystemRequired: true`.) |
| `magazine-web-ppt` | Editorial "magazine × e-ink" aesthetic (WebGL fluid background, serif titles, chapter plates). When the brief asks for a keynote / launch / sharing-style deck and calls out Monocle / WIRED / Kinfolk / Domus. |
| `replit-deck` | The brief explicitly asks for Replit-Slides gallery aesthetic, or needs one of the 8 token-frozen visual identities (SaaS board, editorial memo, gallery catalog, Y2K campaign, policy report, museum chapter, consumer cards). No dependency on `DESIGN.md`. |

If the user just says "make me a deck" without further guidance, default to `simple-deck` — it respects their design system. Pick `replit-deck` only when the brief is explicit about the aesthetic or names a theme.

## Scope & provenance

- **Eight themes = the full replit.com/slides landing-page gallery at the time of snapshot.** Not a curated subset — every theme card currently published on replit.com/slides is represented here (helix, holm, vance, bevel, world-dark, world-mint, atlas, bluehouse). If Replit ships a ninth template, it is **not** automatically reflected in this skill.
- **Snapshot date: 2026-04-29.** All hex values were sampled from the actual replit.com/slides PNGs on that date with ImageMagick — no guessed colors, no memory substitutions. See `references/themes.md` → *Contributing a new theme* for the exact sampling procedure.
- **Maintenance: one-time snapshot, not tracked.** Replit Slides is a live product and may drift. This skill does not auto-sync. If you notice Replit has updated colors or added a theme and want it reflected here, open an issue on `nexu-io/FreeCode` titled `replit-deck: re-sync to replit.com/slides (YYYY-MM-DD)` and attach the updated screenshots. There is no designated owner monitoring the upstream.
- **No Replit branding.** These are gallery-style templates, not a Replit-brand deck. The checklist (P0) forbids inserting a Replit logo or wordmark.

---

## Browser / runtime support

- **Target**: modern evergreen desktop browsers (Chrome 110+ / Safari 16+ / Firefox 115+) and modern mobile Safari / Chrome.
- **Features used**: CSS scroll-snap (horizontal), `color-mix()`, CSS custom properties, `text-wrap: balance`. All ≥ 93% Baseline.
- **Not supported**: IE 11, Safari < 15, any browser without `color-mix()` (would need a fallback `--accent-soft` if you want to support older Safari; out of scope for this skill).
- **Mobile**: horizontal scroll-snap works on iOS Safari 16+ and Android Chrome. Keyboard nav is desktop-only by design.
- **Nav script behavior**: reused verbatim from `design-templates/simple-deck` — survives iframe embedding (the daemon preview surface), dual listener races, focus loss, and position persistence across reloads. **Do not rewrite it.**

## Verification

The design template auto-registers with the daemon on filesystem scan (no manual wiring). Confirmed against a running daemon on `localhost:7456` after adding this template:

```bash
$ curl -s localhost:7456/api/design-templates \
    | node -e "const d=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(0,'utf-8')); \
               console.log(JSON.stringify(d.designTemplates.find(t=>t.id==='replit-deck'), null, 2));"
{

```

All four example decks (`examples/example-{helix,holm,atlas,bluehouse}.html`) open directly in a browser. Keyboard nav (← / → / Space / Home / End) and horizontal scroll-snap work in Chrome 129 and Safari 18.
