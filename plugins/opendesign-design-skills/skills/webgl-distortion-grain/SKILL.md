# Distortion & Grain

Produce a single self-contained `index.html` — A vertical gallery (Three.js) where planes bend with scroll velocity, ripple under the cursor via simplex noise, and carry a film grain.

## Why this is a powered artifact

FreeCode detects `getContext('webgl2')` / heavy WebGL and renders this file in **powered preview** (a cross-origin-isolated iframe). The full GPU + scroll pipeline runs; no opaque-sandbox workarounds are needed.
