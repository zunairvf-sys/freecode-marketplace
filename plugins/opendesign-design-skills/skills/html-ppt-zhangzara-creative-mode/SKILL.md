# Creative Mode

> Cream paper canvas with confident multi-color (green, pink, orange, yellow) accents and Archivo Black display.

A single self-contained HTML deck — typography, palette, decorative system,
and slide vocabulary are all tuned together. Mixing layouts across templates
breaks the system; stay inside this one.

## At a glance

- **Scheme:** light
- **Formality:** medium
- **Density:** medium-high
- **Slides in demo:** 8

## Best for

Anything that should feel design-led and confident: creative agency pitches, design studio decks, ad shop credentials, brand creative reviews, art-direction reviews. Also a great unexpected pick for a tech talk, research findings, or finance review when the speaker wants to lead with taste rather than convention.

## Avoid for

Contexts that demand institutional restraint and a quiet authority — the saturated multi-accent palette will read as expressive, not formal.

## Workflow

1. **Clone `example.html` AND the `assets/` folder** into the user's workspace.
   This template ships an `assets/deck-stage.js` runtime (keyboard navigation,
   stage rendering); the HTML references it as `assets/deck-stage.js`, so the
   file must sit next to the cloned HTML or that path will 404 in the generated
   artifact and navigation will silently break. Inlining the JS into a single
   `<script>` block in the HTML is an acceptable alternative when a single
   self-contained file is preferred.
2. **Replace placeholder content** with the user's real headlines, body copy,
   numbers, names, dates, and section labels. Match existing dimensions when
   swapping image placeholders.
3. **Preserve the design system.** Never substitute fonts, recolor the palette,
   restructure the layout grid, or strip decorative elements (corner brackets,
   paper grain, geometric shapes, illustrated SVGs). They are part of the
   identity.
4. **Adjust deck length by duplicating layouts.** If the user has more content
   than the demo holds, duplicate an existing slide of the most appropriate
   layout. If less, drop slides from the bottom. Update page-number labels.
5. **Designing missing layouts:** if a slide needs a layout the template
   doesn't have, design it from scratch using the same fonts, palette,
   decorative vocabulary, spacing rhythm, and component grammar — never bail
   to a different template.
6. **Keep the navigation runtime as shipped.** If the deck ships an
   `assets/deck-stage.js` or inline keyboard handler, leave it intact.

## Output contract

Emit between `<artifact>` tags:

```
<artifact identifier="zhangzara-creative-mode" type="text/html" title="Deck Title">
<!doctype html>
<html>...</html>
</artifact>
```
